Internship Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset


📌 Overview

This task is part of my internship program, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.
The goal of this task was to:

Understand the dataset structure.

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Generate meaningful statistical insights.

Create visualizations to identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Import & Inspection

Loaded dataset into pandas DataFrame.

Checked dataset dimensions, datatypes, and missing values.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.

Removed duplicates (if any).

Corrected inconsistent entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis (distribution plots, histograms).

Bivariate analysis (correlation heatmaps, scatter plots).

Statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation).

Visualizations

Histograms for numerical features.

Bar charts for categorical features.

Heatmap for correlation analysis.
