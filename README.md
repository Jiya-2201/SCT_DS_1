Internship Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset
📌 Overview

This task is part of my internship program, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.
The goal of this task was to:

Understand the dataset structure.

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Generate meaningful statistical insights.

Create visualizations to identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

pandas → Data manipulation & cleaning

numpy → Numerical computations

matplotlib → Data visualization

seaborn → Advanced visualization

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Import & Inspection

Loaded dataset into pandas DataFrame.

Checked dataset dimensions, datatypes, and missing values.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.

Removed duplicates (if any).

Corrected inconsistent entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis (distribution plots, histograms).

Bivariate analysis (correlation heatmaps, scatter plots).

Statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation).

Visualizations

Histograms for numerical features.

Bar charts for categorical features.

Heatmap for correlation analysis.

📊 Sample Visualizations

(If you have PNG images saved, you can add them here. Example below)


✅ Conclusion

The dataset was successfully explored and cleaned.

Multiple insights were derived from visualization and statistics.

This task provided a solid foundation for data understanding before moving to advanced analytics and modeling.



✨ This project is part of my internship journey in Data Science & Analytics.
